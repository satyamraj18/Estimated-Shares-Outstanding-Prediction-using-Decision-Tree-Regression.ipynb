# Estimated-Shares-Outstanding-Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Regression.ipynb
This ML Model is based on Decision Tree Regression. Here we are trying to predict the Estimated Shares Outstanding. It was trained on various regression model like SVR, Decision Tree Regression.
It was observed that the r2 is max, MAE, RMSE and MSE is minimum when we take Decision Tree Regression. It was checked with various values of "n_estimators" but it was observed that the performance was optimal when we have 100 as value.
